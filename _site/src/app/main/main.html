	<p>PwC are back for a fourth year to bring you analytics on the top performing horses from our analysis of historic race data.</p>
	<p>Why does the Melbourne Cup stop the nation?</p>
	<p>The Melbourne Cup captures the attention of millions of people around the world. It is a race between the best horses, with the best jockeys, on a record length track of 3,200m. To add to the mix, the race is handicapped, meaning the top horses usually carry more weight to equalise the chances across the field.</p>
