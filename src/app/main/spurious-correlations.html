    <p>With Australians packing on the porky pounds over the last 5 years, it's no surprise that the winning horse has had to do more work carrying those chubby cherubs across the line.</p>
    <p>Although racing authorities set the weights for race day, the saddle can only weigh so little.</p>
    <p>Statistical analysis has also shown that highly weighted horses actually have higher chances of winning, which may actually be a sneaky strategy of bacon lovers around the country.</p>

  <div ng-if="correlationSelect.index == 2">
    <p>As economic times get tough and jobs become harder to find, Australians have been turning to the horse racing industry as a way of making ends meet.</p>
    <p>Behind every Melbourne Cup entry is a team dedicated to fulfilling every whim of the horse so that it can focus on one thing - running.</p>
    <p>However, these are very much part time jobs and it's no surprise that they head back to hunt in the job market once the races are over.</p>

  <div ng-if="correlationSelect.index == 3">
    <p>The Melbourne Cup is known as 'the race which stops the nation' but is also less widely known as 'the race which boosts the economy'.</p>
    <p>Malcolm Turnbull will be hoping for a strong Cup attendance this year as a secret weapon to help balance that pesky budget. It can't just be the import of all those international superstars and foreign horses, behind all the champagne and and finery, the wheels of business grind away at the Cup, working hard to support the economy and boost Aussie exports... and have a bit of fun!</p>

    <p>So... the more spirits consumed, the shorter the name of the winning horse... This one had our experts stumped. A working theory is perhaps there was a longer horse name created as the spirits were consumed, but the next morning no-one could remember what it was, so a short name was quickly made up on the spot..? Our experts have selflessly volunteered to field test this theory to establish its credibility...</p>
