Here we bring you the nitty gritty of what was done and the pros and cons of each approach.</p><p>The approaches we used this year include the tried-and-tested linear regression model, the new classification model via. machine learning, and a return of the ELO rating prediction model. However before starting the actual modelling we gathered a lot of data and expert input to hone in on what matters when it comes to picking winners.</p><p>First up, we used web scraping scripts to gather as much data as we could for over 50 thousand horses and over 1 million race results (race with 24 horses would have 24 race results). Xyz% of the race results were excluded as they did not have any prize money. Jockeys and trainers usually preserve their horses for the bigger races when there is financial incentive. Having such a big dataset allowed us to thoroughly test the model’s validity before including variables that we believed to be useful.</p><p>The next step was to understand the intersection of variables that matter (via. research and expert input) and variables we were able to collect information on. This intersection was made up of race odds, horse speed & form, weight carried, track condition preference of the horse, and barrier position in each race.</p><p>Armed with both the data and a hypothesis of what matters when it comes to predicting races the team set off from an even playing field to predict the top 5 placing horses.</p></div><div ng-if="methodSelect.index != 0" class="prediction"><div class="p10 clearfix"><div class="css-cell w20 text-center clearfix" ng-repeat="i in [0,1,2,3,4]" id="horse{{i + 1}}"><span class="horse-number">{{i + 1}}</span><div class="horse-gif-holder"><div class="horse-gif" style="margin-top: {{barSize(methodSelect.odds[i])}}px; height: {{barHeight(methodSelect.odds[i])}}px"><img src="/assets/images/horsie-run-white.gif" alt="running horse"> <span>${{methodSelect.odds[i]}}</span></div></div><h4>{{methodSelect.horse[i]}}</h4></div></div><div ng-if="methodSelect.index == 1"><h2>{{methodSelect.name}}</h2><p>An old favourite of predictive modellers, this method applies a linear multiplier to each predictor to determine an expected finishing time and thus place of each horse.</p><p>It is often the first method to use for many predictive problems.</p><h3>Pros</h3><p>Relatively simple, easily interpretable, and widely accepted by the business and scientific community.</p><p>It is also widely accessible via statistical software packages (e.g. SAS, R) or even MS Excel for smaller datasets.</p><h3>Cons</h3><p>The assumptions inherent in a linear model simply do not apply to many real-world phenomena.
